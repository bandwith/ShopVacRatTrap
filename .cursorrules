# ShopVac Rat Trap 2025 - AI Rules

## Project Context
This project is an IoT-based rodent control system using ESP32-S3, ESPHome, and Python.
It involves hardware control, 3D printing, and automated BOM management.

## Coding Standards
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8. Use `ruff` for linting and formatting. Type hinting is required.
- **ESPHome**: Use modular YAML configurations.
- **OpenSCAD**: Parameterize models. Use comments to explain geometry.
- **General**: Keep files clean. Remove unused code.

## AI Behavior
- When generating Python code, always include type hints.
- When modifying OpenSCAD files, ensure the `$fn` parameter is set for smooth curves (e.g., `$fn=100`).
- Do not suggest changes that violate safety standards (NEC/IEC).
