## 🔧 System Architecture

**Modern Design Improvements:**
- ✅ **Horizontal & Modular Design**: Lays flat for stability and uses snap-fit connectors for easy, tool-free assembly.
- ✅ **Large 4-Inch Opening**: Accommodates a wide variety of rodent sizes.
- ✅ **Removable Bait Station**: Allows for easy baiting without disassembling the trap.
- ✅ **All-in-One Electronics Enclosure**: All electronic components are housed in a single, commercially available enclosure for maximum safety, reliability, and code compliance.

## Theory of Operation

The reliability of the trap hinges on its multi-stage detection logic, which is designed to be both highly sensitive to rodents and resilient to false positives. The system operates entirely offline, meaning a WiFi connection is not required for the core detection and trapping functionality.

The detection process unfolds in a sequence as a rodent enters the trap:

1.  **Stage 1: Primary Detection (Proximity)**
    *   **Sensor**: APDS9960 Proximity/Gesture Sensor
    *   **Location**: Positioned at the top of the trap tube, looking down.
    *   **Function**: This is the first line of detection. The APDS9960 emits infrared light and measures the reflection. When a rodent passes underneath, the reflected light intensity increases sharply, triggering the first detection flag. This sensor is highly effective for detecting the presence of a nearby object without being fooled by minor environmental changes.

2.  **Stage 2: Secondary Confirmation (Distance)**
    *   **Sensor**: VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensor
    *   **Location**: Positioned at the bottom of the trap tube, looking up.
    *   **Function**: If the primary sensor is triggered, the system queries the ToF sensor. This sensor measures the exact distance to the object above it. A valid reading (e.g., a distance corresponding to the height of a rodent) confirms that a physical object is inside the tube, rather than just a shadow or a change in light. This provides a crucial secondary confirmation.

3.  **Stage 3: Tertiary Backup (Motion)**
    *   **Sensor**: PIR Motion Sensor
    *   **Location**: Positioned on the side of the trap tube.
    *   **Function**: The PIR sensor detects the infrared radiation (heat) emitted by a moving animal. It serves as a robust backup and a third data point. Its wide field of view ensures that any movement within the trap zone is detected.

4.  **Trigger Logic: 2 of 3 Confirmation**
    *   The vacuum is only activated when **at least two of the three** detection systems are triggered simultaneously. This "2 of 3" logic is the key to preventing false positives. A single sensor anomaly (e.g., a flash of light fooling the proximity sensor, or a warm draft affecting the PIR) will not trigger the trap. This redundancy ensures that the system is confident that a rodent is inside before activation.

5.  **Evidence Capture (Camera Variant)**
    *   **Sensor**: OV5640 5MP Camera
    *   **Function**: If the camera variant is used, a high-resolution image is captured the moment the trap is triggered. This image is then sent to Home Assistant for logging and notification, providing visual confirmation of the capture.

This layered, multi-sensor approach ensures that the trap is both effective and reliable, minimizing the chances of false alarms while maximizing the probability of a successful capture.
