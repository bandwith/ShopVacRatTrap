- Updated all savings calculations to **-$62.75 (30.0% reduction)**
- Verified all percentage breakdowns match actual component costs

### 2. **Component Inconsistencies - RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

**Issues Found:**
- Battery still listed in purchasing files despite being removed in optimization
- Barrel jack connector incorrectly included in Adafruit order
- SSR part numbers differed between old (COM-14456) and new (COM-13015)
- Component counts varied between files

**Corrections Made:**
- Removed battery (258) and barrel jack (1944) from all purchasing files
- Updated all references to use SSR COM-13015 (40A chassis mount)
- Unified component count to **17 items** across all documentation
- Updated BOM_CONSOLIDATED.csv to match final optimized design

### 3. **ESPHome Configuration Issues - RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

**Issues Found:**
- Current monitoring sensor referenced in main config but no corresponding BOM entry
- Budget and TTGO configs inconsistently marked as deprecated
- Sensor configurations referenced components not in final BOM

**Corrections Made:**
- Removed CT clamp current monitoring from rat-trap-2025.yaml (no SCT-013-020 in BOM)
- Added clear deprecation warnings to budget and TTGO configs
- Updated ESPHome config comments to reflect actual $62.75 savings
- Cleaned up sensor polling and display references

### 4. **Documentation Cross-Reference Issues - RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

**Issues Found:**
- Inconsistent cost references across multiple files
- Power supply specifications varied (LRS-35-5 vs LRS-15-5)
- Installation guide referenced incorrect component specifications

**Corrections Made:**
- Updated all power supply references to LRS-15-5 (correct current design)
- Fixed installation guide component list and cost savings figures
- Updated ELECTRICAL_DESIGN.md to include final BOM cost in summary
- Corrected 3D model comments to reflect actual achieved savings

### 5. **Version/Date Inconsistencies - RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

**Issues Found:**
- Not all files consistently dated August 2025
- Version information inconsistent across documentation

**Corrections Made:**
- Added consistent "Last Updated: August 10, 2025" references
- Added BOM version identifier (v2025.08.10) to main README
- Updated all file headers and summaries for consistency

### 6. **Purchasing File Automation - UPDATED** ‚úÖ

**Issues Found:**
- Generated purchasing files didn't match manually corrected BOM
- Cost calculations in automation scripts referenced old totals

**Corrections Made:**
- Regenerated all purchasing files using corrected BOM
- Updated Adafruit order to remove battery and barrel jack
- Updated SparkFun order to use correct SSR part number
- Verified Mouser upload file matches current design

## üìä Final Verification Results

### **Unified Project Specifications:**
- **Total Cost:** $146.10 (all files consistent)
- **Component Count:** 17 items (all files consistent)
- **Cost Reduction:** $62.75 savings, 30.0% reduction (all files consistent)
- **Power Supply:** LRS-15-5 (5V/3A) - all references updated
- **SSR:** SparkFun COM-13015 (40A) - all references updated

### **Cost Breakdown (Verified Consistent):**
- **Adafruit:** $81.50 (55.8%) - 12 components
- **Mouser:** $49.65 (34.0%) - 4 components
- **SparkFun:** $14.95 (10.2%) - 1 component

### **Files Updated for Consistency:**
1. `BOM_CONSOLIDATED.csv` - Removed battery and barrel jack
2. `README.md` - Updated costs, savings, and version info
3. `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Fixed all cost calculations
4. `purchasing/PURCHASE_GUIDE.md` - Updated via automation
5. `purchasing/adafruit_order_consolidated.csv` - Removed unnecessary items
6. `purchasing/sparkfun_order_consolidated.csv` - Updated SSR part number
7. `esphome/rat-trap-2025.yaml` - Removed current monitoring, updated costs
8. `esphome/rat-trap-budget.yaml` - Added deprecation warning
9. `esphome/rat-trap-ttgo-display.yaml` - Added deprecation warning
10. `ELECTRICAL_DESIGN.md` - Fixed formatting and added final cost
11. `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - Updated component specs and costs
12. `3D Models/Control_Box_Enclosure.scad` - Updated cost summary

## üîç Verification Methods Used

1. **Automated BOM Calculation:** Python script to verify actual totals
2. **Cross-Reference Search:** grep searches for cost inconsistencies
3. **File Generation:** Regenerated all purchasing files from corrected BOM
4. **Manual Review:** Line-by-line review of critical cost and component references

## ‚úÖ Post-Review Status

**All identified inconsistencies have been resolved.** The codebase now maintains:

- ‚úÖ **Unified pricing** across all documentation
- ‚úÖ **Consistent component specifications** in all files
- ‚úÖ **Accurate BOM totals** verified by calculation
- ‚úÖ **Proper cross-references** between documentation files
