## 📊 Cost Impact Summary

| Component | Original Cost | Corrected Cost | Difference |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Panel LED | $5 | $8 | +$3 |
| Fuses (2x) | $6 | $4 | -$2 |
| Heat Sink | $2 | $3 | +$1 |
| Thermal Pad | $1 | $2 | +$1 |
| **Net Impact** | **$14** | **$17** | **+$3** |

## 🎯 Updated Project Totals

### Budget Configuration
- **Previous Total**: ~$143
- **Corrected Total**: ~$147
- **Net Cost Reduction**: Still -$53 from original design
- **All components verified and available**

### Enhanced Configuration  
- **Previous Total**: ~$164
- **Corrected Total**: ~$167
- **Net Cost Reduction**: Still -$31 from original design (15% savings)
- **All components verified and available**

## ✅ Verification Process

All corrected components have been:

1. **✅ Verified on Octopart.com** - Confirmed searchable and available
2. **✅ Cross-referenced with Mouser** - Direct links and part numbers confirmed
3. **✅ Specifications validated** - Electrical and mechanical compatibility verified
4. **✅ Mounting compatibility** - Physical form factors confirmed
5. **✅ Cost updated** - Current pricing reflected in BOMs

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### Component Selection Criteria
- **Availability**: Must be in stock at major distributors (Mouser, Digikey)
- **Verification**: Part numbers must exist in Octopart database
- **Specifications**: Must meet or exceed original component requirements
- **Cost**: Minimize impact while maintaining functionality
- **Reliability**: Prefer established manufacturers with proven track records

### Future Verification Process
1. **Pre-design**: All components verified in Octopart before inclusion
2. **Regular Updates**: Quarterly verification of component availability
3. **Alternative Sources**: Maintain backup suppliers for critical components
4. **Cost Monitoring**: Track price fluctuations and optimize as needed

## 📋 Implementation Notes

### For Budget Builds
- All corrected components maintain essential functionality
- Thermal management performance preserved with verified heat sink
- LED indication functionality maintained with correct Schneider part
- Circuit protection maintained with verified Littelfuse fuses

### For Enhanced Builds
- Same component corrections apply
- Additional EMI suppression components already verified
- Current monitoring system uses verified CT clamp (SCT-013-020)
- All safety features maintained with verified components

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **✅ BOMs Updated** - Both budget and enhanced BOMs corrected
2. **✅ Documentation Updated** - All references to old part numbers corrected
3. **🔄 Procurement Ready** - All components now available for immediate purchase
4. **🔄 Build Testing** - Ready for prototype builds with verified components

This component verification ensures the project maintains its high safety standards and cost optimization goals while using only verified, available components from reputable suppliers.
