This work is based on the original ShopVac Rat Trap design:

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware
designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use,
study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on
those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three
variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W
(weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or
their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.

1. Definitions

  1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-P.

  1.2 'Compatible Licence' means

       a) any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or

       b) any version of the CERN-OHL-S or the CERN-OHL-W, or

       c) any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which it
          applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-W provided that on
          Conveyance of any such Source, or any associated Product You treat
          the Source in question as being licensed under the latest version
          of CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-W as appropriate.

  1.3 'Source' means information such as design files, design documentation,
      hardware description language files, circuit or circuit board layout
      files, mechanical drawings and files, 3D models, assembly
      instructions, documentation and any additional material which, alone or
      put together, is sufficient to reproduce the whole or any part of a
      Product.

  1.4 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object, whether
      in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use, application or
      processing of Source.

  1.5 'Patent' means a patent, a utility model, a design or topography right,
      or any other similar statutory right or statutory right to exclude
      others from manufacturing, using or selling something.

  1.6 'You' includes any individual or legal entity exercising rights under
      this Licence.

  1.7 'Conveyance' means any act by which a Party transfers or communicates
      Source or Products to another Party.

2. Applicability

  2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveyance of Source
      and manufacture and distribution of Products. By exercising any right
      granted under this Licence, You irrevocably accept these terms and
      conditions.

  2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and shall apply
      whenever You exercise any right granted under this Licence.

  2.3 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing, or any
      other similar right.

3. Copying, modifying and Conveying Source

  3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Source, in any medium,
      provided that You retain all copyright, patent, trademark and
      attribution notices that are present in the Source.

  3.2 You may modify Source and Convey modified Source, provided that You:

       a) retain notices in accordance with Section 3.1; and

       b) add a notice to the modified Source indicating that You have
          modified Source, including the date of modification and a brief
          description of the modification.

  3.3 You may not attempt to alter or restrict the Recipients' rights in the
      Source specified in Section 3.1 and 3.2.

  3.4 You may not attempt to charge the Recipient, in money or otherwise, for
      exercising any rights granted under this Licence.

  3.5 You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
      rights granted or affirmed under this Licence.

4. Manufacture and distribution of Products

  4.1 You may manufacture or distribute Products, provided that where such
      manufacture or distribution requires a licence under any Patent
      implemented in Source, You grant an irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide
      licence under those Patents to all Recipients to manufacture, use,
      sell, offer for sale, and import Products.

  4.2 You are not required to grant this Patent licence for Products that You
      delete, add or change, but if You do so You must grant the licence for
      the remaining Products.

  4.3 You may manufacture Products for any purpose, including commercial
      purposes, provided that the manufacture could take place under this
      Licence.

  4.4 You may distribute Products for any purpose, including commercial
      purposes, provided that the distribution could take place under this
      Licence.

5. DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY

  5.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Source and any Products are provided 'as
      is' and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited
      to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-
      infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose
      or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the maximum
      extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no representation that any
      Source or Product does not or will not infringe any Patent.

      interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty,
      tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in
      any way in relation to the Source, modified Source or the use,
      manufacture or distribution of Source or any Product, even if advised of
      the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free
      and harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses,
      including claims by third parties, in relation to such use.
