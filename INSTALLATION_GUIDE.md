### **Phase 2: Electrical Assembly**

#### **2.1 AC Power Section Assembly**

**DANGER: Disconnect all power before working on AC sections**

1. **Install IEC C14 Power Inlet**
   ```
   - Mount in rear panel of control box
   - Verify proper grounding connection
   - Use locknut and sealing gasket
   ```

2. **Install Circuit Breaker**
   ```
   - Mount 5A breaker in accessible location
   - Connect Line (Hot) wire from IEC inlet
   - Verify proper operation (should trip at 5A)
   ```

3. **Install NEMA 5-15R Outlet**
   ```
   - Mount in rear panel for vacuum connection
   - Prepare for SSR switching of Line connection
   - Ground and Neutral directly connected
   ```

4. **Optimized Single Power Supply Installation** ⭐
   ```
   - Mount LRS-35-5 with proper ventilation clearance (simplified design)
   - AC Input Screw Terminals:
     * L (Line) ← Connect after 15A circuit breaker and 15A fuse
     * N (Neutral) ← Connect to main neutral bus
   - DC Output Screw Terminals:
     * +5V/7A → ESP32 VIN (single supply solution)
     * GND → Common ground bus
   - ESP32 Built-in 3.3V Regulator:
     * Powers VL53L0X, OLED, and all 3.3V components
     * 600mA capacity >> 99mA actual load (84% safety margin)
   - Verify outputs: 5V ±0.25V, ESP32 3.3V stable under load
   - Isolation Test: Verify >1MΩ between AC and DC sides
   ```

#### **2.2 DC Electronics Assembly**

1. **ESP32 Mounting**
   ```
   - Install on standoffs in control box
   - Ensure USB port accessibility
   - Route antenna away from switching circuits
   ```

2. **Sensor Connections (INLET HUB-BASED - OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION)**
   ```
   Inlet Hub-Based Assembly (Minimized Cable Runs):

   AT INLET AREA:
   QWIIC/STEMMA QT 5-Port Hub (Adafruit 5625)
      ├─ Port 1 → VL53L0X ToF Sensor (50mm cable - co-located)
      ├─ Port 2 → BME280 Environmental (100mm cable - inlet area)
      ├─ Port 3 → [Reserved for Camera Module]
      ├─ Port 4 → [Reserved for Additional Sensors]
      └─ Port 5 → [Reserved for Future Expansion]

   AT CONTROL BOX:
   ESP32-S3 Feather STEMMA QT Port
      ↓ (Single 500mm STEMMA QT cable to inlet hub)
   QWIIC Hub at Inlet (upstream connection)

   OLED Display (Adafruit 5027)
      ↓ (Direct 100mm cable to ESP32 in control box)

   MAJOR BENEFITS of Inlet Hub Placement:
   - ✅ Only 1 cable run between control box and inlet (vs. 3+ separate runs)
   - ✅ Environmental monitoring at actual rodent entry point
   - ✅ Simplified installation with single main cable route
   - ✅ Reduced EMI susceptibility on short sensor cables
   - ✅ Camera and additional sensors can be added at inlet without new cable runs
   - ✅ All detection components accessible at inlet for maintenance

   Alternative: STEMMA QT Daisy Chain Assembly (Legacy):
   ESP32-S3 Feather STEMMA QT Port
      ↓ (100mm STEMMA QT cable)
   VL53L0X ToF Sensor (Adafruit 4210)
      ↓ (100mm STEMMA QT cable)
   BME280 Environmental Sensor (Adafruit 4816)
      ↓ (200mm STEMMA QT cable)
   OLED Display (Adafruit 5027)

   Power Budget Verification:
   - ESP32-S3 3.3V regulator: 600mA maximum capacity
   - Total 3.3V load: ~99mA typical (84% safety margin)
   ```

3. **Simplified Control Interface Wiring**
   ```
   Reset Button (GPIO18):
   - One side → GPIO18
   - Other side → GND
   - 10kΩ pull-up to ESP32 3.3V output

   Test Button (GPIO19):
   - One side → GPIO19
   - Other side → GND
   - 10kΩ pull-up to ESP32 3.3V output

   Illuminated Emergency Disable Switch - SAFETY CRITICAL:
   - Switch Contact Side:
     * Common → GPIO4
     * NO → GND
     * 10kΩ pull-up to ESP32 3.3V output
   - LED Side:
     * Anode → GPIO17
     * Cathode → GND

4. **SSR Control Circuit (Enhanced with Optocoupler Protection)**
   ```
   ESP32 GPIO5 → 4N35 Optocoupler Protection Circuit:

   Input Side (ESP32):
   GPIO5 → 330Ω Resistor → 4N35 LED Anode
   4N35 LED Cathode → ESP32 GND

   Output Side (SSR):
   4N35 Collector → SSR + Control
   4N35 Emitter → SSR - Control (GND)

   AC Switching (unchanged):
   - Input Common → Line from circuit breaker
   - Output NO → Line to NEMA outlet

   Benefits:
   - Double isolation: ESP32 ↔ Optocoupler ↔ SSR ↔ AC Load
   - Total isolation: >8000V (4N35: 5000V + SSR: 4000V)
   - Protects ESP32 from voltage spikes and noise
   - Standard industrial practice for safety-critical switching
   - Minimal cost addition: ~$1.50
   ```
